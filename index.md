# Daily progress tracking
```
In grad school I fell into the practice of scribbling notes into small notepads. It took several years before I was able to articulate why I was doing it though.

Each day, I wrote down a few bullet points of what I did. I probably spent less than 2 minutes on it. I found that tracking my daily progress has a number of benefits:

The next day, I can quickly resume working by looking at what I wrote yesterday.
When I feel like I am stuck, it is motivating to look back and see the progress.
It catalogs all of my efforts (what worked and what didn't).
At the end of the week, I can summarize the daily bullet points to update my advisor/mentor/manager/team/lab.
At the end of the month, I can summarize the weekly bullet points to track my progress towards bigger goals.
It makes it easy to update my resume/CV and to fill out performance reviews.
It is surprisingly easy to forget what you worked on last week, let alone last month.


In the future I want to experiment with posting my daily progress in a public form.
